## This is a fullstack project assignment submitted to Litost India ltd.

# Instructions

## Prerequisites

- Must have nodejs installed
- You can use any package manager
- Backend is under development and not functional as of yet

## Run Strapi CMS

- cd into the cms folder
- enter the following command
```bash
pnpm develop
```
- Strapi admin will open, enter user details and get started.
- Seperate instance of db is not required as we're using the built-in SQLite db for simplicity.

## Run the frontend app

- on another terminal, cd into the frontend directory
- run the following command
```bash
pnpm dev
```
- Frontend application will start after installing dependencies


# The Project

## Tech Stack

- For frontend, I used NextJS and Mantine UI Library.
- For the cms admin panel, I used Strapi
- For the database, I utilized the built-in SQLite in strapi for quick development and simplicity. Db can changed later.
- For the backend, for performing auth and updating website content, I plan to use NodeJS and expressjs, with strapi's api.
- Until the backend is developed, the strapi admin panel can be used to perform updates on the website content.
